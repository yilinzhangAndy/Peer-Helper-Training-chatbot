    "answer": "Robotics, Autonomy, Controls & Optimization - Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering\nFaculty Positions Available ➡️\nMore Information\nAutonomy and robotics are fields that are focused on developing systems and devices that can operate independently, without the need for human intervention. Robotics involves the design, construction, and programming of physical machines that can perform tasks, while autonomy refers to the ability of a system to make decisions and take actions on its own. Together, these fields have led to the development of a wide range of applications, including self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots used in manufacturing and healthcare. The goal of autonomy and robotics is to create systems that can perform tasks more efficiently, accurately, and safely than humans, and to free humans from repetitive or dangerous tasks.\nFeedback control systems involves the use of feedback from sensors that inform a decision or algorithm that enables a process to achieve a desired outcome. Optimization seeks to maximize or minimize a user defined cost function. Often these fields are combined to form optimal control which involves determining the best action or decision to maximize or minimize a reward. Complexity in these domains arise when the governing dynamic models are high dimension, nonlinear, or contain uncertainty. Additional challenges arise when feedback is limited, erroneous, or needs to be protected. Such challenges arise in single processes and can be exacerbated when distributed across a network of processes. Control and optimization methods cut across almost every domain of our society with impacts in all disciplines of engineering, including societal impacts such as how we grow and gather food, how we power our homes, how all forms of transportation get us from point A to point B, how we communicate through networks, how we provide healthcare, and how we explore our universe.

Our team aims to improve the efficiency and cost of solar thermochemical hydrogen production by taking advantage of new “redox materials” that can be integrated with efficient solar collectors developed by industry. “By leveraging the technological expertise of our industrial partner, Synhelion, we are able to integrate new materials into solar thermal processes which have the potential to lower H\nproduction costs”, says project Principle Investigator\nJonathan Scheffe\n, of U. Florida’s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.\nToday, most of the world’s hydrogen production comes from natural gas, a process that, while cheap, does not address the United States and world’s energy and climate concerns. This project will potentially enable large scale production of “green” hydrogen from solar energy by leveraging\nconcentrating solar power\n(CSP) infrastructure and the heat of the sun to split H\n. The produced H\ncan then be stored, transported and utilized on demand, for example in transportation sectors that are focused on decarbonizing their industries.\nThe University ",

A major focus in our lab is understanding how the nervous, muscular, and skeletal systems interact to maintain balance (or not!) while navigating the complex demands of daily-life mobility. Our goal is to enable clinicians and other rehabilitation scientists to better prescribe rehabilitation interventions, develop assistive devices, tune patient-specific control of robotic devices such as exoskeletons, and more.\nYou can learn more about our research by watching the below video and visiting our\n, Facilities, and",

    "answer": "Dr. Jing Pan earns National Science Foundation’s CAREER Award and grant - Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering\nFaculty Positions Available ➡️\nMore Information\nDr. Jing Pan, a UF MAE professor, won a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation last month. This honor is the most prestigious award granted by the NSF, and comes with a federal research grant.\nPan’s winning proposal was about developing a biosensing technology for monitoring chemicals and biomolecules in bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, or saliva. This technology will help patients with compromised immune systems, which cause a substantial number of deaths every year and are one of the costliest conditions to diagnose and manage. It will also allow medical professionals to make better clinical decisions with more information about the disease trajectory of patients.\nCurrently, most medical diagnostic tests only give a single point measurement, and getting the result usually takes hours, or even days. This is inadequate for patients who are unstable and who suffer from severe injuries or systemic immune malfunctions. In situations like intensive care units and emergency care, for example, patients’ conditions can change more quickly than they can be measured. This issue was especially prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many patients died due to a rapid deterioration of organ functions that was difficult for doctors to track.\n“However, if we rush to interfere with the immune system blindly, we risk breaking the delicate balance in patients’ bodies even faster, as disease trajectories and medical conditions differ from person to person,” Pan said. “We really need a technology that can help us see the hidden dynamics in patients’ bodies to enable adaptive and personalized medical interventions.”\nPan explained that the main goal of his project is to develop sensors that can continuously monitor molecular indicators of immune status in the body.\n“Similar to how, to use th",

His team’s ambitious plans will take flight on the evening of March 14, when a payload containing their bioengineered microbes will be launched at 8:30 p.m. on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).\nHis team is funded by the Biomanufacturing: Survival, Utility, and Reliability beyond Earth (B-SURE) program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the US Department of Defense that provided him with a $2.8 million grant for space biomanufacturing research and at least one research flight to the ISS. The team includes another UF MAE professor, Dr. Sean Niemi, as well as researchers from NASA’s Ames Research Center, Rhodium Scientific, the University of Delaware, and the University of California, Berkeley.\nThe goal of B-SURE is to establish a resilient supply chain that can support a sustained human space presence.\n“Because it’s so expensive to send stuff into space, one way to cut costs is to manufacture necessities in space itself using local resources,” Menezes said. “What we’ve previously shown is that using biology for this manufacturing can further cut costs over traditional mechanical and chemical techniques. But this approach remains to be tested.”\nIt all starts with the UF researchers in Menezes’s lab bioengineering microbes to synthesize nutraceuticals and biopolymers and then checking performance in reduced gravity experiments aboard the ISS.\n“This study is a stepping stone toward our long-term vision of engineering cells to make all the things humans will need in space",

    "answer": "Grad student Suhas Tamvada achieves influential discovery in heat transfer - Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering\nFaculty Positions Available ➡️\nMore Information\nMAE graduate research assistant Suhas Tamvada has made a major discovery in the field of heat transfer, a breakthrough that addresses a question debated in nucleate boiling science for decades.\nThe research and its findings have recently appeared in the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer\nTamvada’s research, conducted alongside UF MAE’s Dr. Saeed Moghaddam and scientific consultant Daniel Attinger, owner of Struo LLC, addressed the two prevailing theories regarding critical heat flux (the maximum amount of heat that can be transferred from a surface to a liquid while boiling). The proposed theories on the existence of this limit had to do with hydrodynamic instability (a phenomenon happening away from the boiling surface) and evaporation momentum force theory (happening on the surface itself). These two theories predicted roughly similar critical heat flux values, but the team’s paper shows that the evaporation momentum limit is 3 to 4 times higher than previously thought. Tamvada’s paper describes how, though these are two contrasting phenomena, they both are present throughout the entire boiling process. However, his research showed that, provided with the right experimental conditions, it is possible to overcome the limit imposed by the hydrodynamic instability and establish a flow condition wherein the evaporation momentum limit can be observed as the ultimate limit.\n“That has a lot of implications,” he said. “Now people can start rethinking the entire surface design for different applications, because now the physics is no longer ambiguous.”\nCritical heat flux is a crucial factor in many real-world applications, such as cooling of nuclear reactors, data centers, and power electronics. For example, the capacity of a nuclear power plant is determined by the maximum heat flux that ",

    "answer": "MAE Spin-Off AIBL Tech Advances to the UF Big Idea Competition Sweet 16 toward Commercializing AI-Enabled Prosthetic Arms - Center for Engineering Design\nExercising grit, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit, a team of UF capstone senior design students advanced to the Sweet 16 of UF’s prestigious Big Idea Business Plan Competition. The team of Meredith Giangaspro, Aidan Henriksen, Yuliia Hrynchenko, John Mallari, Haydn Rhodes, and Jake Rosken is forming AIBL Tech, a company that integrates AI-driven real-time object recognition into prosthetic arms.\n“Our technology uses real-time object recognition to anticipate what item the user is reaching for,” AIBL Tech’s CEO John Malari said. “The prosthetic hand then forms the correct grasp for the identified object, enabling the user to pick it up without need for manual control.”\nThe Big Idea Competition is hosted by UF’s Warrington College of Business each Spring. It awards over $50K in prizes to top teams with the winner receiving $25K, complimentary office space at the UF Gator Hatchery start-up incubator, and mentoring from UF’s entrepreneurship community. From a starting pool of over 100 competitors AIBL Tech was selected as a top 16 finalist to pitch their product to a panel of judges. Based on the pitches, four finalists are selected to compete for the top prizes.\n“Integration of the Big Idea Competition with our mechanical engineering capstone class allowed us to leverage what we learned in classes to develop a product with huge positive impact for upper arm amputees,” Yuliia Hrynchenko, AIBL Tech’s COO said. “Using our skills and knowledge to create a commercial product that helps people live better is incredibly rewarding.”\nAIBL Tech was incubated in the UF Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Department’s capstone senior design program, taught by Senior Lecturer and Instructional Associate Professor Matthew J. Traum. The course is structured to train students in product development through real-world exper",
